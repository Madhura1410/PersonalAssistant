# AI-Powered Personal Assistant for Education

This project is a simple AI-Powered Personal Assistant designed to help students with educational queries. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all contained within a single file (`index.html`).

## Features

- **User Interaction**: Users can type questions or statements, and the assistant will respond based on predefined keywords.
- **Responsive Design**: The assistant is styled to be visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **Keyword-Based Responses**: The assistant provides responses based on keywords found in the user's input.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the assistant's interface.
- **JavaScript**: For handling user input and generating responses.

## Getting Started

To run the AI-Powered Personal Assistant, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or download the `index.html` file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser of your choice.
3. Start interacting with the assistant by typing your questions in the input field and clicking the "Send" button.

## Example Usage

- Type "hello" to receive a greeting.
- Ask about "homework" or "study" for tips.
- Inquire about "exam" for encouragement.

## Customization

You can customize the assistant's responses by modifying the `getAssistantResponse` function in the JavaScript section of the `index.html` file. Add or change keywords and their corresponding responses as needed.
